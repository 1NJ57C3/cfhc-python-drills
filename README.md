# Python Drills  
  
This is a a collection of solutions I've written for the mini-projects, or drills, that were used to (independently) learn Python at Coding for Hermit Crabs. Please do NOT copy/steal my code. I have shared it publically for the programming community's use as reference material for writing your own. If any of your code is heavily based on mine, please accredit me atop your README as `[1NJ57C3/Injustice](https://github.com/1NJ57C3)` and provide a link to the original source code.
